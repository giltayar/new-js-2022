// I don't use class. I never found a use for it!
//
// But some people do, so this is for them.

// But let's say I want to hide `r`. I can do this, which is what lots of people do

// This is nice, and for me, sufficient enough!
//
// (well, I would do wihout, but that's me:)

// But for some use cases, the need to hide is real (e.g. API-s). We can do this:

// But we can still enumerate the properties and get at the private field

// And use that to get at the field:

// Ouch.
//
// So whadda we do? We use private fields!

// Now nobody can access the field outside the class!

// Let's try and circumvent by injecting a function into the object!

// What about injecting it into the proototype?

// No way to circumvent it! ðŸŽ‰
